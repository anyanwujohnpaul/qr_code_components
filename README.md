### Built with

- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

Building the recipe page was a bitter-sweet experience for me, actually looked very simple and basic but at first i couldn't my way around it but after thorough research and also learning new css concept like flexbox it became fun and exciting to carr on with the project. In summary, I learned to be calm, patience and do lots of research when working on something new or totally different.

### Continued development

I look forward to getting better with CSS (the advanced part) and keeping on building/designing cool, user-centric and aesthetic UI for users.

### Useful resources

- [W3School CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - This helped me learn and grasp CSS concept like CSS Flexbox, I t was my first time working with flexbox, It was kinda hard to understand at first but after deeply going through material and resources from W3School it became easierr to understand.
